To study **MiniLibX** and implement **FDF** (a wireframe 3D viewer project typically done in 42 school) **in less than one week**, youâ€™ll need a **highly focused and practical approach** â€” assuming you already have some C knowledge and basic graphics/math skills.

Here's a **step-by-step plan** with the best resources and approach to **master MiniLibX and FDF quickly and powerfully**:

---

## âœ… What You Need to Know First

1. **C Programming**: Solid understanding of pointers, structs, memory allocation.
2. **Basic Math**:

   * 2D & 3D coordinates
   * Matrix transformations (rotation, translation)
   * Projection (isometric vs parallel)
3. **MiniLibX Basics**:

   * Creating a window
   * Drawing pixels, lines
   * Handling events (keyboard, mouse)

---

## ðŸ”¥ 6-Day Intense Study + Build Plan

### ðŸ“… **Day 1: Understand MiniLibX Basics**

* Learn how to:

  * Open a window
  * Draw a pixel
  * Close the window with ESC or mouse event
* ðŸ’¡ Study from:

  * âœ… [42Paris' MiniLibX doc (official)](https://harm-smits.github.io/42docs/libs/minilibx)
  * âœ… Example Repo: [MiniLibX Simple Examples (by qst0)](https://github.com/qst0/ft_libgfx)

**Practice**:

* Open a window
* Fill it with a color
* Draw one pixel at the center

---

### ðŸ“… **Day 2: Drawing Lines with Bresenham Algorithm**

* Learn Bresenhamâ€™s line algorithm (essential for FDF).
* Implement a function to draw lines between two points.
* Practice drawing a grid.

**Resources**:

* âœ… [Bresenham's Algorithm Explanation (cs115)](https://www.cs.helsinki.fi/group/goa/mallinnus/lines/bresenh.html)

---

### ðŸ“… **Day 3: Parse the FDF Map File**

* Write a parser for the `.fdf` file format.
* Each line = row of numbers (height)
* Store in a 2D int array or a struct with x, y, z values.

**Practice**:

* Load and print a height map to terminal first.
* Visualize the points as dots.

---

### ðŸ“… **Day 4: Connect the Points**

* Use your Bresenham line function to connect each point to its right and bottom neighbors.
* Render the full wireframe grid in 2D.

---

### ðŸ“… **Day 5: Add Transformations & Projections**

* Learn and implement:

  * Isometric projection
  * Scaling (zoom)
  * Moving the view (pan)
  * Rotate on X/Y/Z axes (bonus)

**Resources**:

* âœ… [FDF Projection Theory Explained (in simple terms)](https://github.com/evansegura/FdF/wiki/Isometric-Projections)

---

### ðŸ“… **Day 6: Keyboard Controls & Polish**

* Add interactivity:

  * Arrow keys to move
  * +/- to zoom
  * R to rotate
* Add color based on height (optional but beautiful)

---

### ðŸ“… **Day 7 (Optional)**: Add Features / Refactor

* Dynamic color mapping
* Smooth animation (bonus)
* Memory management cleanup
* Struct reorganization

| Parsing                                      | From .fdf to usable data  |
| Event Handling                               | Controls and UI           |
| Matrix math                                  | Rotation / projection     |

## ðŸ’¡ Powerful Implementations Examples

1. **42 student repos with advanced FDFs**:

   * Search GitHub for: `fdf 42` â€” filter by stars or try:

     * [https://github.com/afnizarnur/fdf](https://github.com/afnizarnur/fdf)
     * [https://github.com/mbuon/FdF](https://github.com/mbuon/FdF)

2. **YouTube tutorials (fast-paced)**:

   * Look for: `FdF project tutorial 42` or `FdF MiniLibX explained`
   * Example: [FdF Tutorial by Evil Rabbit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEA-jBgX4Jo)

---

## âœ… Tools to Help

* **Valgrind**: Check for memory leaks
* **GDB or LLDB**: Debugging segfaults
* **Git**: Commit each working feature (track progress & rollback)

---

## ðŸ”§ Bonus: Development Setup

* Use **VSCode with C extensions** or **Vim + makefile**
* Have a clean `Makefile` with rules for:

  * `make`
  * `make clean`
  * `make re`
